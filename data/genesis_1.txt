Insan say Katawan a Dios angalay dabuk ed dalin, minoli ton sakey a too-too, insan to iningasan na linawan manangiter na bilay ed saray abut na eleng to, et nagmaliw a mabilay a too. #### then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
Insan say Katawan a Dios nanggawa na sakey a tanamanan diad bandad bokig a sakop na Eden, tan diman to impanayam imay toon minoli to. #### And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Pinatubo to rad may amin a klasiy mararakep a kiew tan pinabunga to ra na masasamit a prutas. Diad pegley na tanamanan so kawalaan na kiew a mangiiter na pakaamta ed maung tan maoges. #### And out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.

Ingganggan tod sikato, Nayarian mon kaney bunga na antokaman a kiew ed tanamanan, #### And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
balet ag ka mamangan na bunga na samay kiew a mangiiter na pakaamta ed maung tan maoges.

Insan inkuan na Katawan a Dios, Aliwan maung a mambukbukor so too. Igawaan ko na sakey a manepeg a kaiba to tan katulongan to. #### Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.”
Kanyan nanmoli na dalin tan sayan minoli to ginawa ton ayayep tan manomanok. Insan to ra inyakar ed samay too, ta nengnengen to no antoy pangingaran tod sikara. No antoy impanawag tod balang sakey, sikatoy ngaran to. #### Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.

Samay too sirin initdan toy kangaranan iray amin a manok tan ayayep; balet anggapod saraya so manepeg a kaiba to tan katulongan to. #### The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.

Inmebat imay bii, Nayarian min kanen so bunga na dinanman a kiew ed tanamanan, #### And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, 
likud ed bunga to may kiew a walad pegley to. Imbagay Dios ed sikami ya ag mi kanen odino diwiten so bunga to man a kiew; no kanen mi o diwiten mi, ompatey kami. #### but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”
Inkuanto may oleg, Aliwan tua tan; ag kayo ompatey. #### But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die.
Imbagay Dios itan ta amta ta a no kanen yo, magmaliw kayon singa Dios ya amta yo no anto so maung tan maoges. #### For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
Anengneng na samay bii a marakerakep imay kiew tan masamsamit a kanen so bunga to, tan sakey a pampilpilalekan a pakagamuray kakabatan. Kanyan amorbor na bunga, insan to kinan. Initdan toy asawa to, tan kinan to met. #### So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise,[b] she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
Kapangan da, naitdan iray pakatalus tan naamtaan da a labus-lakseb ira; kanyan nandadait iray bolung na igos, insan da intapi-tapi. #### Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
Nen ngarngarem la arengel da so tanul na panaakar na Katawan a Dios ed tanamanan, kanyan inamutan dad otel na kakiewan. #### And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 
Balet tinawag na Katawan a Dios imay laki, "Iner so kawalaan mo?" #### But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”
Inmebat imay laki, "Arengel ta kad tanamanan; antakot ak ta labuslakseb ak, kanyan inamutan ta ka." #### And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.”
Tinepet na Dios, Siopay angibagad sikan labus-lakseb ka? Kinan mo sirin imay bunga ya imbagak ed sikan ag mo kanen? #### He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”
Inmebat imay laki, Samay biin inter mon kaibak et inter tod siak imay bunga, insan ko kinan. #### The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.”
Tinepet na Katawan a Dios ed samay bii, "Akin et ginawam so ontan?" Inmebat imay bii, "Pinalikdo ak na samay oleg, et angan ak na samay bungay kiew." #### Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
Insan inkuan na Katawan a Dios ed samay oleg, Nadusa ka lapud sayan ginawam; sika labat so nisamba ed amin da ray ayayep. Saya so dusam: Manlapud natan manilak-ilak ka, tan say dabuk so kanen mo legan mon mambilay. #### The Lord God said to the serpent,“Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
Pambosulan ta ka tan samay bii; mambosulan lawas so anak mo tan say anak to. Temeken na anak to so olom tan ketketen mo so mokur da. #### I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”
Inkuanto natan ed samay bii, Aruman koy gunigon mo no manlokun ka tan nairapan ka ed pananak mo. Anggaman ontan, pampilalekan mo nin siansiay asawam tan sikatoy manoley ed sika. #### To the woman he said, “I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to[f] your husband, but he shall rule over you.”
Inkuantod samay laki, Dinengel moy asawam tan kinan moy prutas ya imbagak ed sikan ag mo kanen. Lapud sayan ginawam, nisambay dalin. Nakaukolan a mansagput kay baleg legan mon mambilay, pian mangiter so dalin na malaem a taganom. #### And to Adam he said, “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
Patuboen to ray dika-rika tan sabisabit, tan mangan ka ray tantanaman a balang. #### thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
Nakaukolan moy manlinget tan mansagput na baleg, pian makaiter so dalin na antokaman a napambilay ya anggad ipatey tan ipawil mod dalin a nanlapwan mo. Nanlapu kad dalin, tan magmaliw ka lamet a dalin. #### By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”
Eva so impangingaran nen Adan ed samay asawa to, ta sikatoy ina na amin a katoowan. #### The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.

Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever ”
Kanyan say Katawan a Dios pinataynan tod tanamanan na Eden imay too, pian nadalusan toy dalin a nanlapwan na laman to. #### therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
Diad bandad bokig na tanamanan na Eden angipasen na saray kirubin tan sakey a mandarlang ya ispada a manwasiwas ed amin a dapag, pian anggapoy makaasingger ed samay kiew na bilay. #### He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life.
